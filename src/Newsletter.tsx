              <p>Before proposing a solution, treat the crossing as a design problem. Where do drivers naturally look? How wide does the road feel? How long is the crossing? Where does a pedestrian hesitate? The goal is to identify which physical cues may be encouraging speed or uncertainty.</p>

              <h2>A real local problem.</h2>
              <p>Bedford’s Transportation Advisory Committee documented three pedestrian deaths involving vehicles in roughly two years: one on Shawsheen Road in 2022 and two on Concord Road in 2024. The town has also identified speed, accessibility, and missing sidewalk/bicycle connections as concerns at the Concord Road/Reformatory Branch Trail crossing.</p>
